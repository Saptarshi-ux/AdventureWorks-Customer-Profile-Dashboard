# Creating an Ideal Customer Profile Dashboard with Power BI for AdventureWorks Bikes

I’m excited to share a **Power BI dashboard** I recently developed for **AdventureWorks Bikes** to analyze and visualize their **customer profiles**. This project involved blending various demographic and behavioral data points—such as **age**, **annual income**, **marital status**, **gender**, **education level**, and **occupation**—to uncover who the “ideal” AdventureWorks customer might be.

## Key Dashboard Highlights

1. **KPI Cards**:  
   - **Average Age**: 55 years (as of 2017)  
   - **Average Annual Income**: ~₹57K  

2. **Demographic Visuals**:  
   - **Gender Distribution**: Quick view of male vs. female customers.  
   - **Marital Status**: Pie chart illustrating single vs. married customers.  
   - **Age Distribution**: Column chart showing the spread of customers across different age brackets.

3. **Socioeconomic Insights**:  
   - **Family Size**: Pie chart revealing household composition (based on total children).  
   - **Home Ownership**: A separate pie chart indicating how many customers own their homes.  

4. **Occupation & Education**:  
   - **Occupational Structure**: Bar chart categorizing customers as Clerical, Managerial, Professional, etc.  
   - **Educational Distribution**: Bar chart showing highest education levels (High School, Bachelors, Masters, etc.).

5. **Income Analysis**:  
   - **Income Distribution**: Bar chart highlighting different income bands, providing insights into the buying power and spending capacity of AdventureWorks customers.

## Why This Matters

- **Marketing & Targeting:**  
  By knowing the average age and income, the marketing team can design campaigns that resonate with the right audience segments—whether it’s premium bike lines for higher earners or family-friendly options for larger households.

- **Product Development:**  
  Understanding educational and occupational backgrounds can guide product innovation or promotional bundles that align with specific lifestyles or job roles (e.g., commuter bikes for professionals).

- **Geographic & Demographic Strategy:**  
  Combined with location data (if available), these insights help refine store placement or online targeting strategies.

## How I Built It

- **Data Transformation:**  
  I used Power Query to clean, shape, and combine multiple sources (customer demographics, sales data, etc.).

- **Data Modeling:**  
  Established relationships between tables (e.g., Customers, Orders, Products) to ensure accurate cross-filtering.

- **Visualization:**  
  Leveraged **KPI cards** for at-a-glance metrics, **pie charts** for categorical breakdowns, and **column/bar charts** for distributions.

- **Interactivity:**  
  Implemented slicers and cross-highlighting so users can click on any chart segment to filter other visuals in real-time.

## Next Steps

- **Deep-Dive Analytics:**  
  Explore time-series trends (e.g., changes in average income or occupation mix over the years).

- **Segmentation & Clustering:**  
  Combine these insights with advanced analytics (like R or Python in Power BI) to segment customers into actionable groups.

- **Predictive Modeling:**  
  Use machine learning approaches to forecast future purchasing behaviors based on demographic shifts.
